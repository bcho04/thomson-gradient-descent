Gradient descent for Module 4 Project 1 of Multivariable Calculus.

## Problem Statement

Consider five points, A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 on a unit sphere, centered at O.  What configuration of these points maximizes the minimum central angle AiOAj for any i and j?  Can you generalize to the situation where there are N points?  How might this problem be related to the classical Thomson problem, described in the following two articles?

## Usage

After download repository, to install packages run `npm install`.

To set the number of points to optimize for, open `js/main.js`, and change the variable of the `num_bodies` variable to desired integer.

To run the simulation, run `npm start`. The visualization will most likely run at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
